1. We can make a hidden file by command:
 touch .hiddenFile

Filenames beginning with dot are meant to make the file invisible.

We change the visibility of the file by:
 mv someFile.txt .someFile.txt

We can use the ls -a command to display the hidden file in CLI. 


2.We can create multiple nested directories like this:

 mkdir -p myPets/dog myPets/rats iWish/racoon/pictures 

3. To create file from the task #3 we have several methods:
   - using echo command:
	echo "first message" > someNewFile.txt
	echo "second message" >> someNewFile.txt

   - using vim 
	vim someNewFile.txt 
		and created messages in a text editor
	:wq - save and quit.

   - using notepad command or code .
